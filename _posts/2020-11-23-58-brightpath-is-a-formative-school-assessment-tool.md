description:

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over running a
formative school assessment tool for 800+ schools in Australia. It's built with
Django and it's been running in production since 2017 on AWS.

Kye is the solo developer on the project. It's a monolith split across 10+
Django apps. They've gone all-in with a bunch of AWS services and Kye sticks to
a number of best practices such as having tests, linting and using services to
help keep things running smoothly.
