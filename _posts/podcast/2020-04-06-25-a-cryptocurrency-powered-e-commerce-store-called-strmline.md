  Ty Cooper talks about building an e-commerce shop with Flask and goes over
  how it's hosted with Firebase and PythonAnywhere.

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
cryptocurrency powered e-commerce store with Flask and Python. It's hosted on
Firebase along with PythonAnywhere and has been up and running since October
2019.

Ty talks about the challenges of accepting cryptocurrency (specifically
Ethereum), how he hosts the site using Firebase and PythonAnywhere, why he
chose those services, the value of end to end tests using Selenium, the
benefits of working with someone else instead of trying to do everything alone
and more.
