  Stetson Blake shares his tech choices for building a SAAS app with Flask.
  It's all hosted on a single AWS EC2 instance.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over how he
built [EarlyBrd]({{ page.guest_website }}) using Flask which is a web framework
written in Python. This SAAS app focuses on sending out emails and it also
happens to use Stripe for subscriptions. It's been up since March 2019.

Stetson's motto has been to keep moving forward by writing code and making
decisions instead of getting hung up in endless research loops. His set up is
optimized for simplicity and to solve the problems he's run into so far as a
solo developer working on the project.

## Topics Include
