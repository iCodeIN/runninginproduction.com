  Ian Davidson goes over building a data sharing service with Phoenix and
  Elixir using Live View. It's hosted on DigitalOcean.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
data sharing service using Phoenix and Elixir. It's using Live View too. At its
peak the site received a spike of 10k+ requests in a day and it's hosted on a
$20 / month DigitalOcean server.

Ian talks about quickly building the app, reacting quickly to add user
requested features, using DigitalOcean for the first time, some pitfalls of
using Live View / websockets when it comes to configuring nginx and more.
