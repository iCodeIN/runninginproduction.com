title: "Zego Lets You Easily Buy Insurance by the Hour"
description:
  Stuart Kelly goes over creating an insurance company with Django. They've
  issued over 290 million hours of insurance so far. It's all hosted on AWS.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} lets us know what it's
like to build an insurance company from scratch with Django and Python. It's
been running in production since early 2017 and they've issued out 290+ million
hours of insurance so far. It's hosted on AWS.

Stuart covers building an MVP in 8 weeks, using Stripe with SCA, creating 25+
Django apps over time, working with a GraphQL API back-end, querying 45+
million DB rows quickly, making app deploys a pleasant experience for his team,
achieving 99.99% uptime and so much more.
