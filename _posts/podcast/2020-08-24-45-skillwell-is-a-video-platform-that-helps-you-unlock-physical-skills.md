description:
  John Debs goes over building a video platform with Django to help get you

---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks about building
a video platform with Django that helps you get stronger and be more flexible.
It's hosted on a single $5 / month DigitalOcean server and has been up and
running since fall 2019.

John really drives home the value in shipping something simple on the first pass
and iterating on it if there ends up being demand for it.
