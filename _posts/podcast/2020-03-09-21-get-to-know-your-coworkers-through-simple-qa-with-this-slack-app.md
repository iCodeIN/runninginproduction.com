In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building
a Slack bot service with Phoenix and Elixir. It's hosted with Gigalixir for
about $50 / month and has been up and running since mid 2018.

Adam talks about the wonderful Elixir community along with how Elixir helps him
manage a bunch of concurrent tasks for his service. He also goes over a number
of features that you get from using Gigalixir to host your Elixir projects.
