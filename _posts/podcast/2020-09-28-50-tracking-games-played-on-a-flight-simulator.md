In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks about building
a leader board for a [flight simulator]({{ site.url }}{% asset_path
podcast/50/simulator.jpg %}){:target="_blank"} that he developed at University.
It's built with Django and Python and runs on the Heroku free tier. It was in
development for most of the 2019 school year.

Paul goes over using QR codes as a login mechanism and what it was like
building an API back-end so that the game server (Unity) running the simulator
can report back stats.
