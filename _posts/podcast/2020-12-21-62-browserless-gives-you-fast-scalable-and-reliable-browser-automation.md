In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
service to run headless browsers using Express, Node and Docker. It's been up
and running since late 2017 and runs on just under 1,000 DigitalOcean servers.

Joel talks about handling millions of browser sessions, breaking the app up
into a few pieces, using Redis as a primary database, using Stripe, creating a
custom Node CLI for helping automate deployment tasks and so much more.
