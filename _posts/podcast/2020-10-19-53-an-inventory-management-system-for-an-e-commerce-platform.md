In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} walks us through
building an internal inventory management system with Django and Python. It's
running on a single bare metal server and has been up and running since 2013.

Galen talks about replacing an Excel sheet with a custom app, using 20 Django
apps, taking advantage of the Django admin and deploying everything onto a
custom server.
