In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building
an e-commerce store with Django that processes up to 3,000 orders per second.
It's running on 12+ web servers on DigitalOcean and the site has been up and
running since 2014.

Dan covers building an API backed app with Vue on the front-end, handling
thousands of concurrent websocket connections, using Authorize.Net for payments
and deploying to a bunch of web servers that are managed by Ansible with
Fabric.
