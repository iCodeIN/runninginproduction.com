In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over using
Django to build a social hiring platform for the food and beverage industry.
It's hosted on Heroku and took about 9 months of full time development to
build as a solo developer.

Colin talks about building 2 separate apps and keeping the web app as a
monolithic app with ~42k LOC, but it's broken up with Django apps.
Elasticsearch is used to power an auto-complete search feature. Billing isn't
implemented yet but it's currently in development with Stripe.
