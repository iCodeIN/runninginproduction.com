  Kshitij Sinha goes over building his job finding platform with Django.
  It's hosted on a single t2 micro AWS instance using the free tier.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} walks us through his
job finding platform called Creative Hire. It was written in Python and Django
and is hosted on AWS' free tier. It's been up and running since early 2020
after the MVP was built in about 6 weeks.

Kshitij is the solo developer on the project. It's a monolith split across a
few Django apps with 2 git repos (one for the back-end and one for the
front-end). It does a quite a bit of NLP to help categorize submissions and
more.
