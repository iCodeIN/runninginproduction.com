title: "Muze Is a Freeform iOS Chat Application" 
description:
  Dash Winterson talks about building a new type of iOS chat app using Django
  and Python on the back-end. It's hosted on AWS.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks about building
a new type of chat app for iOS using Django and Python on the back-end. It's
hosted on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and has been up and running since mid
2020.

Dash covers creating async compatible code in Django, developing a monolithic
back-end that a few developers develop against, investing in the AWS ecosystem,
end to end message encryption and the Zen of Python.
