title: "Divio Is a Cloud Platform for Managing Web Applications"
description:

  apps using Django. It's hosted on multiple cloud providers.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} walks us through
their cloud platform to manage web apps using Django. 10s of millions of web
requests flow through their client's applications. It's running on multiple
cloud providers and has been up and running since 2015.

Daniele covers the importance of a stable platform when you're dealing with
customers who have their own customers, writing upwards of a million lines of
Python across their services, being vendor neutral with hosting infrastructure
and more.
