title: "Building a Site Around Thousands of Diary Entries from Samuel Pepys"
description:
  Phil Gyford goes over building a site around Samuel Pepys with Django. It
  gets around 150k+ monthly page views and is hosted on Heroku.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
community around 9+ years of diary entries from Samuel Pepys. The site was
built with Django. It gets about 150k+ page views a month and has been up and
running since 2002. It's currently hosted on Heroku.

Phil talks about being in the sweet spot in terms of engagement while not being
under high load, rewriting the platform with Django as a monolith, how Heroku
helps him get it all up and running without needing to bother with servers and
much more. The site is [open source](https://github.com/philgyford/pepysdiary).
