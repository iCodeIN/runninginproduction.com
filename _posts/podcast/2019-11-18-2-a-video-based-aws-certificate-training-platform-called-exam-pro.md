title: "A Video Based AWS Certificate Training Platform Called Exam Pro"
description:
  Andrew Brown talks about using Ruby on Rails to build an AWS certificate
  training platform called Exam Pro. He is all-in with AWS.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks about how he
and his team use Ruby on Rails to build an AWS certification training platform
called [Exam Pro]({{ page.guest_website }}). We talked about a huge range of
AWS services and how they all come together to run and deploy his application.

They've gone all-in with AWS. Even their development environment is running on
AWS using Cloud9 IDE. Exam Pro has been running in production since late 2018.
