In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} talks about building
a video course platform with Express and Node. It's hosted on a single $10 /
month DigitalOcean server. It took about 3 months of part time development and
has been up and running since late 2017.

SQLite and not being afraid to build something from scratch. He covered a lot
of ground in this episode.
