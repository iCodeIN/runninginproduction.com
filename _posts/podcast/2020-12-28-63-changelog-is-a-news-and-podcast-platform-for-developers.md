title: "Changelog.com Is a News and Podcast Platform for Developers"
description:
  Jerod Santo & Gerhard Lazu go over building a news and podcast platform
  with Phoenix / Elixir. It's hosted on Linode's Kubernetes Engine.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} and {{ page.guest_2
}} go over their news and podcast platform which is using Phoenix and Elixir.
It was rewritten in Phoenix back in 2015 and it runs on Linode's Kubernetes
Engine across a 3 node cluster.

Jerod and Gerhard talk about building a context-less Phoenix app, using
Turbolinks, caching, transitioning to using Kubernetes, automating as much as
possible while focusing on patterns that work for small teams and so much more.
