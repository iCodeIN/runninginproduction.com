In this episode of Running in Production, Nick briefly talks about the goal of
this podcast which is to have developers / engineers on the show who are
running any web application in production. Guests will go into why they chose
their tech stack, lessons learned and everything in between.

## Topics Include

- 0:41 -- A site to learn details about how folks are running their site in production
- 1:13 -- Are you a developer / engineer who runs a site in production? Become a guest
- 1:25 -- From small side projects to massive sites at scale, everyone is welcome
- 1:52 -- There's also email based interviews if you want to do that instead
- 2:10 -- I can really use your help getting this site off the ground (I'm not kidding!)
