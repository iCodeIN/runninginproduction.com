title: "Collecting and Processing Genomic Data to Help Cure Rare Diseases"
description:
  Dan Kolbman goes over building an internal tool to process Genomic data
  using Django and Python. It's all hosted on AWS.
---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over using
Django to build an internal tool that helps make sense of ~5 Petabytes of
Genomic data that is then made available to clinicians. It's running across
many different AWS resources using ECS Fargate.

Dan walks us through what their app does, dealing with loads of data, using
GraphQL, getting away from using Serverless and going mostly all-in with AWS.
Their apps are open source too. The ones we'll be talking about are on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/kids-first/kf-api-study-creator) and
[here](https://github.com/kids-first/kf-api-release-coordinator).
