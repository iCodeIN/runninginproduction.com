In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building a
sales and CRM tool with Flask and Python. It's hosted on a few cloud providers
such as AWS and Linode. It was created in mid-2019.

Nidal talks about using MongoDB, splitting tenants out with their own
individual servers, mixing in Vue where needed, using Ansible and he also drops
great advice around moving forward and shipping code without chasing perfection.
