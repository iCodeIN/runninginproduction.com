title: "Creating a Non-profit Food Ordering Service for Inner City Kids In LA"

  Fransico Barcena talks about building a food order processing system with

---

In this episode of Running in Production, {{ page.guest }} goes over building an internal
food order processing system for the city of Los Angeles, CA with Flask and
Python. It's hosted on a single DigitalOcean server and has been up and running
since 2016.

Francisco talks about developing a freelance project for a client as a solo
developer, scraping the USDA's site, working with Flask-SocketIO to create a
real-time ordering service and getting everything up and running on a single
server without using Docker, CI or configuration management tools.
